Hello!

We wanted to help some newer developers or solo-developers who are fresh to the FiveM realm. This is a super simple resource, but can be effective for those starting out.

This resource allows you to modify a config file to place blips anywhere on the map. It is all handled automatically.

There are 2 examples already within the config to help you along the way.

As always, feel free to join our new Discord for support. This is our first resource of many that we are releasing to the public.
